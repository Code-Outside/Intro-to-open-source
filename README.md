## What is git.

It is a free, high-quality distributed version control system suitable for tracking modifications in the source code in software development. It was originally created as an open-source system for coordinating tasks among programmers, but today it is widely used to track changes in any set of files.

The key objectives of Git are as follows:

- Speed and efficiency
- Data integrity
- Support for distributed and non-linear workflows


#### Extras

Git is open Source. It is mostly used by people who want to make the projects without having any trouble with code deletion.
